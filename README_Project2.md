## Team's approach 

### 1. Overview of Findings from Part 1

In Part 1 of our project, we set out to analyze a dataset of customer shopping habits with the goal of uncovering patterns that could inform marketing strategies. The dataset included variables such as age, gender, purchase amounts, seasons, and more. Our initial aim was to use this data to explore how different demographic factors influence shopping behavior.

However, as we began our analysis, we encountered several red flags that raised concerns about the authenticity of the dataset. Specifically, we observed minimal significant differences in purchase amounts across various demographic segments like age, gender, discount applied, previous purchases. These results were unexpected, as real-world data typically shows more variability in these areas. 

Additionally, the dataset was already cleaned and contained no missing values—an unusual characteristic for real-world datasets, which often require substantial cleaning. The absence of references to surveys, sampling methods, or any clear data collection process further suggested that the dataset might be generated rather than real.

Due to these concerns, our focus shifted from purely analyzing the data for marketing insights to investigating the nature of the dataset itself. Despite these limitations, we proceeded with the analysis to demonstrate how certain methods could be applied to real-world data projects.

We employed several techniques that are valuable in analyzing customer behavior, including:

- **Linear Regression** to identify potential relationships between variables like age, gender, discount applied, previous purchase and purchase amounts.
- **Grouping Techniques** to segment data and analyze patterns within these groups.
- **Bar Charts** to provide clear visualizations of the data, making it easier to interpret results.
- **Classification Model (K-Nearest Neighbors - KNN)** to predict whether a customer would subscribe based on their shopping habits. The model performed well with an accuracy of 83%, demonstrating the potential of such models when applied to well-prepared datasets.

In summary, while the dataset's authenticity limited its use for drawing real marketing insights, the methods we applied are directly transferable to real-world scenarios. These techniques are essential for analyzing customer data, uncovering trends, and guiding strategic decisions in the retail sector.

### Roles and Responsibilities 
Taking everyone's strength, background and circumstances into consideration, everyone contributed to the group project to ensure successful completion. Jessilynn leveraged Power BI, Shiraz leveraged Tableau, Olena leveraged Python and Mykhailo supporting the team to complete the project. Everyone has consistently participated in discussion and we were able to resolve conflict regarding dataset decision. Everyone has actively communicated and contributed to this project 


### Data Visualization Guide 

#### Main Goals and Objectives of Visualization (What are the main goals and objectives of our visualization project?)
We wanted to see how Total Purchase amount varied from Previous Purchase between different age groups with the ability to drill down the data further with available attributes such as Gender, Location, Season, Payment Method, Subscription Status and Frequency of Purchase. Additionally, we wanted to see if average review ratings differ by gender between age groups with same drill down attributes. 
#### Tailoring Visualization for Effective Communication (How can we tailor the visualization to effectively communicate with our audience?)
Depending on the audience and the information we are trying to convey, visualization can be tailored. For this particular visualization, we've included as many attributes as possible to leverage to draw insights from data. This was particularily important as data was fictious and meaningful insights were not easy to draw out. 
#### Type of Visualization Selection (What type of visualization best suits our data and objectives (e.g., bar chart, scatter plot, heatmap)?)
For Power BI visualization, bar charts with line graph was selected. This visualization was selected becaused we wanted to show case Total Purchase (TY amount) vs. Previous Purchase (LY amount) with their variance in line graph. Variance was calculated in power BI to showcase the line graph 
#### Libraries and/or Frameworks Selection (Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to our project requirements?)
#### Addressing Feedback and Iterative Improvements (How can we iterate on our design to address feedback and make iterative improvements?)
#### Ensuring Inclusivity and Diversity in Visualization (What best practices can we follow to promote inclusivity and diversity in our visualization design?)
#### Ensuring Data Visualization Representation Accuracy (How can we ensure that our visualization accurately represents the underlying data without misleading or misinterpreting information?)
#### Addressing Privacy Concerns or Sensitive Information (Are there any privacy concerns or sensitive information that need to be addressed in our visualization?)
